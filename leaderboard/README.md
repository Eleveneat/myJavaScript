#Leaderboard
an example application that was designed by the Meteor Development Group to show off what Meteor could do with very few lines of code.

To get hands-on time with Leaderboard, visit [leaderboard2.meteor.com](http://leaderboard2.meteor.com) and, while clicking around, take note of its core features:

- There’s a list of players.
- Each player has a score.
- Players are ranked by their score.
- You can select players by clicking on them.
- You can increment a selected player’s score.


#Run
Open the terminal and type:
